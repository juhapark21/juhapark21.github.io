                        <p>That sounds fun! I had an upcoming trip to Yosemite, and I just got a HF radio, so I wanted
                            to
                            try it out. </p>
                        <p>I would have practiced by hunting before, but I was leaving for the trip 2 days after I got
                            the
                            QMX. It’s okay though, I’ll figure it out as I go! </p>

                            Turns out operating from inside a giant natural well doesn’t lead to very good reception
                        </h2>
                        <p>We were going to Tenaya Lake on Monday, so I figured I might as well attempt my first
                            operation
                            there. Most places in Yosemite that are not the valley seemed to be pretty high up, so I
                            thought
                            it would work out. What I forgot: </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>There are lots of trees everywhere, and while it’s good for throwing up EFHW antennas,
                                it
                                was less good in terms of interference.</li>
                            <li>It’s a lake. For water to pool in a lake, the surrounding land has to be higher up. I
                                just
                                tried to operate in a giant basin. </li>
                            <li>The pine trees have pretty flimsy branches, and it’s not the best for throwing up
                                antennas?
                                I didn’t have much of a choice though (only antenna I have is an EFHW). </li>
                        </ul>
                        <h2 id="second-try">Second try</h2>
                        <p>Glacier Point was higher up and seemed much more promising, so I tried once again the day
                            after.
                        </p>

                            learn
                            about the wonderful art of amateur radio</h2>
                        <p>I set up just a few yards off from the back parking lot of Glacier Point. The setup got the
                            attention of a few curious tourists and one tour guide who was <em>very</em> excited to see
                            something new happening in the park. I got to explain what amateur radio was to people and
                            introduce it to them! </p>
                        <h2 id="-can-people-hear-me-">…Can people hear me?</h2>
                        <p>I was operating with a QMX, a QRPGuys EFHW antenna, and a CWMorse straight key. I could hear
                            people anywhere from Washington to Illinois, but when I picked an empty frequency to send
                            out
                            calls, I wasn’t sure if anyone could spot me, or if I’d even been picked up by the RBN. I
                            was
                            eventually spotted, but after a handful of botched contacts where neither of us were able to
                            receive properly, I decided to switch to P2P.</p>
                        <p>P2P was the right choice. Even though I was operating with ~4 watts, I was able to be heard
                            and
                            given priority since P2P contacts are worth more in POTA. It was also easier for me in the
                            same
                            way hunting is easier for beginners — I was able to listen to the activator’s QSOs over and
                            over
                            again to ensure I had their info, so that when I did make a contact with them, I only had to
                            really worry about sending my info correctly and completing the exchange. </p>

                        <p>Before this first attempt, I practiced with Morse Walker and Morse Ninja audio files to get
                            up to
                            at least 15wpm. And I did! For standard exchanges. </p>
                        <p>Since standard exchanges were the only things I really trained to get up to speed, I could
                            receive entire chunks of exchanges but went back down to ~10wpm max for <em>anything</em>
                            outside of the standard phrases... including callsigns...</p>
                        <p>Yeah, it was not the most fun time for receiving spotty CW. </p>
                        <p>In conclusion, I am very sorry to whoever stumbled across a bumbling new ham on 20m on August
                            5th. </p>

                        <p>The receiving struggles didn’t lead to as many busted calls as you might expect, though! I
                            mostly
                            listened in on activators until I got their callsign and state down, so as long as they got
                            my
                            callsign (which they did if they responded to me), we had all the info needed to confirm a
                            contact :) </p>
                        <p>I made 5 P2P contacts total, although only 3 of them got logged (presumably because I wasn’t
                            in
                            the other person’s logs). That meant I failed at activating the park, but it was a fun
                            couple of
                            hours regardless! </p>
                        <p>Once college applications are over, I’m going to go to some California state parks to try
                            activation again. Maybe Mt. Diablo? </p>
